# Dragon-Slayer
A simulation text-based game coded in C++ applying various data structures and patterns

## Introduction
The project revolves around obeying data structure patterns and following its principles to the 
maximum extent. This application is a simulation game. There are a few conditions that must 
be satisfied in order to credit a game as a simulation game. The conditions are a continuous 
runtime loop, the ability to represent an entity’s creating, existence, growth, and destruction, 
the ability for the user to manipulate the attributes of the entities and the environment that they 
are in, they observe what may happen next. We will now see how these conditions fit in this 
game called “Dragon Slayer.” Dragon Slayer is a game which contains two entities, a Slayer, 
and the Dragon. The story revolves around a land where people lived in harmony with dragons 
and shared their land in peace. Until one day, a young boy harmed a dragon to protect his 
little sister. Little did he know that baby dragon was the next-in-line king of the dragon throne. 
Hence, he became an outcast and he was cursed with a curse to protect his tribe from revenge 
of the dragons and bring pride to his kingdom. Until then, he must hunt down the dragons and 
fight them.

The game runs on a continuous loop, until the user decides to quit. The dragon Slayer’s health, 
energy, gold in possession, level, and ASCII art are always displayed at the top of the screen 
throughout the game. These attributes keep changing throughout the game. The slayer gains 
gold whenever he successfully defeats a dragon and rises through the ranks by a level of one. 
There are multiple zones and chambers in the game where the slayer can go to for different 
experiences. If the slayer is running low on health, he may buy a health herb to regain his 
health or buy a potion to regain his energy. These potions are also cursed and come with a 
side-effect which can wear off. The user may also try his luck by attempting to win a bundle of 
gold. The dragon slayer’s name chosen by the user can also be changed in exchange for gold. 
There are ancient lore and tales which the user can read all about in one of the chambers. A 
stack of keys stays hidden behind one of those chamber doors which can be cumulated to 
form one magical dragon key. That dragon key is then used to open the door which leads 
straight to the dragon’s lair where the slayer must go to rise through the ranks and prove his 
worth. The slayer finds objects throughout the game which are saved in the collection to be 
used later. These objects can be items he found or bought such as elixirs, keys, or potions.
The slayer can regain his health after dying once and he is revived with superpowers to 
overcome the power of the dragon. If the slayer dies a second time, the screen goes back to 
main menu where the user can continue his journey. 

In this way, all three conditions of a simulation game are satisfied.

## Data Structures and Patterns
The following structures and patterns are implemented in the program:
- Inheritance and Dervied Classes
- Polymorphism
- Array
- Singly Linked List
- Stack 
- Queue
- Tree
- Abstract Data Type
- Visitor Design Pattern
- Facade Design Pattern
